_Dated Nov 17, 2011 -- Translated from French_


Hi all,

Is our ailing small wind industry in need of more transparency to be taken more seriously by our leaders that could grant the long-awaited feed-in tariff incentive for electricity buy back? Anyhow, this is our opinion and this is why we have taken the initiative of setting up a fully instrumented small wind turbine test site near our company with the desire to make public all the measured real-time data as well as the detailed plans to build such a site at a very moderate cost. We hope many of you will follow our example.

With the free global service developed by www.pachube.com we now have a way to disseminate real-time data on the entire planet and allow anyone to make use of it. Thanks to the Arduino open source technology and the derived Nanode we have an inexpensive way to acquire sensor data and send them to Pachube. Thanks to Analog Devices technology (e.g. ADE7755, ADE7753) we have an inexpensive way to precisely measure the grid energy in both directions (production/consumption). Thanks to IJENKO technology, we have a cheap way to capture and easily visualize the energy contribution from wind (or solar) on the total home energy consumption.

There is an inexpensive way to take wind speed measurement, send it to Pachube in real-time and allow anyone on the planet to get it for use in local, regional or global analysis.

On the other hand, thanks to remote access technologies, a test site may be totally remotely manageable via the Internet, which limits the travel needs to the site.

We want to make available to everyone on an Open Source repository all the details of our electronic boards and software, hoping that this information base will be increased quickly with your contribution. We propose to use the English language so that the whole world can also benefit and contribute. We did not find any initiative as advanced anywhere in the world, so here's a great chance to quickly distinguish us the French. By offering this easy to use brokerage portal of real time sensor information, the English of Pachube have put Microsoft Hohm and Google PowerMeter to shame.

Information for allowing the construction of an identical test site including Arduino /Nanode source code (called Sketches) will be made available within 15 days and earlier by direct email for those who would need it immediately.

To obtain up-to-date information on the project status, follow the links given in the description field of the Pachube feeds that can be found by entering the “Mercinat” search keyword.

The datafeeds of other wind turbines currently on our site and which are undergoing validation before we release them to the market are not available to the public. However manufacturers and partners do get continuous access to this data via secure access.

A Skystream wind turbine placed at 12 meters (in France 12m is the max height with no permitting required) and close to the sea shore is our reference against which we judge the performance of other wind turbines. Our authorization on this site limits the number of turbines to 3 which cannot exceed 12 meters (this is a protected natural zone). The wind measurement tower is equipped with an anemometer and a wind vane Davis at 6m, 9m, 12m and 18m. The electronic for the anemometers and wind vanes is designed by Mercinat based on Arduino/Nanode. The 18-meter aluminum telescopic tower comes from http://www.spiderbeam.com and seems to very well withstand the seaside wind gusts. This is early days and some bugs still exist, which explains the random outages. A reboot of the Arduino boards is performed automatically every 4 hours.

The Windspire vertical wind turbine has been tested and historical comparisons with Skystream data is available and may be made available upon request. The distance between the 2 turbines was less than 20 m. The performances are those announced by the manufacturer Windspire (about half the performance of the Skystream in the same wind conditions). The comparison between the safety control algorithms used by each manufacturer during storms is very interesting.

The two WindTronics turbines installed on the site side-by-side broke down due to a defect in assembly at the factory. We will resume testing after repairs have been completed with a durable solution. We do not publish the test data because the energy conversion solutions proposed by the manufacturers are not yet finalized. This explains why we have not yet validated the roll out of this product in France.

We hope that our initiative will be followed by many of you, unless a better solution exists in which case we will be happy to follow suit. It is easy to imagine that the production of thousands of small wind turbines installed worldwide will be available very soon on Pachube (or equivalent sensor data cloud provider).

The initiatives allowing the capture of real-time sensor data launched by Pachube, Arduino and the others is simply irreversible.

We anticipate that many of you will have interrogations regarding the rationale for such an initiative compared to the role of SEPEN (French National Small Wind Testing facility). Our answer is simple, our initiative is complementary to SEPEN in that it allows – first: manufacturers and distributors to quickly validate their products before marketing them, and the public to get some form of benchmarking on Pachube by simple comparison with a reference product such as the Skystream wind turbine - and second: for companies to be better prepared before submitting products to SEPEN (or another independent test laboratory) and significantly reduce travel (Mercinat being based in Bretagne, we had to travel 900 km each way for the testing -- ouch!).

We anticipate another question - can the Skystream be considered as a reference product? For installations up to 12 meters we are absolutely convinced this makes total sense. What is your opinion?

Sincerely,
